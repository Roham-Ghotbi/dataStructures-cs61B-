Classes:

class Table:
	
	String name;	
	
	Map<String, Column> header;
	
	//connects the header elements to each individual columns
	Map connector;
	
	//array of columns represented by array lists
	Column[] columns;

	//create Column ADT
		class Column:
			String name;
			String type;
			//constructor Column
			public Column(String type, String name) {

				//initialize arraylist with given type
				ArrayList<type> column = new ArrayList;

				this.name = name;
			}

			//create methods for getting column values

	//constructor for Table
	public Table() {
		//initialize each column given the user imputs

		//map the header names to each column
	}
	
One possible problem we will encounter is how to determine the types of the columns when we want to perfom certain operations (i.e. addition, subtraction, etc.)

We will need to define helper methods for our column ADT to get certain values from the columns

We decided to create an entire new ADT for our columns so as to make it easier to control what type each column will be

The items of each columns will be represented by an ArrayList that is held within the column ADT
